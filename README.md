======================

Original version of billiard-ball physics model of the universe.  Many particles attract each other gravitationally.  Particles remain distinct but tend to clump together to form planets due to gravity.  Note that bugs exist in collision model.

Note also that this is C++ code designed to be run in Windows back in ~2005.
